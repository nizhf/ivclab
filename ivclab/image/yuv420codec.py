    Steps:
    1. Convert an image from RGB to YCbCr
    2. Compress the image
        A. Pad the image with 4 pixels symmetric pixels on each side
        B. Downsample only Cb and Cr channels with prefiltering (use scipy.signal.decimate for it)
        C. Crop the image 2 pixels from each side to get rid of padding
    3. Apply rounding to Y, Cb and Cr channels
    4. Decompress the image
        A. Pad the image with 2 pixels symmetric pixels on each side
        B. Upsample Cb and Cr channels (use scipy.signal.resample for it)
        C. Crop the image 4 pixels from each side to get rid of padding
    5. Convert the YCbCr image back to RGB
